        <blockquote>"Dreams without goals are just dreams. and ultimately, they fuel disappointment. on the road, to
            achieving your dreams, you must apply discipline but more importantly, consistency. because without
            commitment you'll never start, but without consistency, you'll never finish" <cite>Denzel Washington.</cite>
